This repository contains all freecad files (*.fcstd) that I am working on, they're available for anyone to peek over my shoulder.

For the moment the product is unfinished, a first usable release should be available in June 2015

STILL TO DO:


 - (hardware) Experiment with the E-Con 13 Megapixel USB camera which I should receive within a few weeks.
 - (harware) develop a method to motorize the take up reel so that I can connect it to my new "loose detector"
 - (electricity) experiment with cutting the 60Hz and the motors interferences to the backlit LED by using a resistor and a capacitor (instead of using a separate power source, the 12V battery)
 - (software) Make my stabilization software more usable with an UI and
 - (software) Make a capture software for whichever camera will be chosen for the task, either the Levenhuk microscope or the E-Con usb camera.
