# gugusse16mm

This repository contains all freecad files (*.fcstd) to construct the 
gugusse 16mm transfer machine.

For the moment the product is unfinished, not really usable but you can do 
small tests runs with it.

STILL TO DO:

A- redesign the square rods for less friction
B- An assembly manual (until then, only the assembly.fcstd file can help you)
C- in and out motorized reel holders
D- The python script to stabilize the image
E- An operator manual
F- Establish precise camera guidelines.
